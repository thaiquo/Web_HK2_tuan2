                <h2>The Corn Maze</h2>
                     <p> Welcome to the Sunny Acres Com Maze. We first heard about mazes from <br>
                         agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe <br>
                         , mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in <br>
                          Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside <br> 
                          of Council Bluffs</p>
                        <p>
                            Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Com Mazes We hope that <br>
                             your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze as we did <br>
                              building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at <br>
                               this year's Com Maze and AutumnFest  </p>
